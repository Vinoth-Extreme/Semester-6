Temperature 
	- temperature in Kelvin

L 
	- Relative Luminosity
	- Amount of light energy emitted by an object per unit time at any piont of its surface.
		Light energy values are normalized from 0 to 1

R 
	- Relative Radius
	- Radius of an object

A_M 
	- Absolute Magnitude
	- The absolute magnitude of a star is defined as the magnitude 
		it would have if it were viewed at a standard distance 
		of 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years). Since the apparent visual magnitude of the 
		Sun is −26.75, its absolute magnitude corresponds 
		to a diminution in brightness…
