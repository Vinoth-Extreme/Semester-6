3. Statistical Analysis
    3.1. Descriptive statistics
              - Data set can be described / summerized by using the descriptive statistics
              - 2 measures. 
                    - 1. Measures of central tendancy
                          - describes about the center position of the distribution
                            *. mean
                            *. median
                            *. mode
                    - 2. Measures of dispersion or variability
                          *. standard deviation or varince
                          *. minimum and maximum variables or range
    3.2. Regression
	      - Establish a relationship model b/w two variables (Predictive and Responsive variable).
	      - eg. y = mx + c
			- here, y = predictor variable
				x = responsive variable
	      - lm() is the function used to create linear regression model
	      - predict() is used to predict values.
