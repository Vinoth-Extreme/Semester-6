Unit III
********

1. Descriptive statistics - to describe the data
	Measures of central tendancy
		1. Mean - mean()
		2. Median - median()
		3. Mode - value occurs frequently in a dataset. Based on Number of Modes,
			1. uni model
			2. Bi model
			3. Tri model
			4. Multi model

	Measures of dispersion - How data is deviated from the mean
		1. Standard Deviation - sd()
		2. Varianve
		3. IQR (Inter Quartile Range) (5 Number Summary) (Q3 - Q1)

2. Distribution
	Normal Distribution - to check data are normally distributed
		** if mean = 0, sd = 1, then this normal distribution is "Standard Normal Distribution".
		1. dnorm(dataset, mean, sd) - Propability value for each data
		2. pnorm(dataset, mean, sd) - normal value to Cumulative Propability Density value for each data
		3. qnorm(dataset, mean, sd) - Cumulative Propability values to normal values
		4. rnorm(dataset, mean, sd) - to generate random normally distributed data.

	Binomial Distribution - only when two possible outcomes.
		1. dbinorm()
		2. pbinorm()
		3. qbinorm()
		4. rbinorm()

3. Regression Analysis - when to find relationship between variables
	Simple linear regression 
		-> y = ax + b
		-> lm(formula, data)
			-> formula -- Predictor Variable ~ indipendant Variable
			-> data -- for what the prediction is to be done.
		
	Multiple 
		-> y = a1x1 + a2x2 + ... + b
		-> 

	Logistic Regression 
		-> When data is categorical. Range should be from 0 to 1 only.
		-> glm()

4. Time Series Analysis
	-> arima()
	-> ts()

5. Anova - aov()
